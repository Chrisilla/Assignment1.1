1. Various sources of Big Data :
	a)archives
	b)docs
	c)business apps
	d)social media 
	e)sensor data

2. 3 V's of Big data :
	a)Velocity:
		There were times when our minds were set to the fact that 
		yesterday's newspaper or yesterday's news updates were the 
		latest news. But now news is getting updated each and every
		second.This refers to the high velocity of big data.

	b)Veriety:
		It is the type and nature of data.
		• Structured data
		• Unstructured data
		• Semi-structured data
		

	c)Volume:
		It refers to the quantity of  data created and stored.

3. Horizontal Scaling and Vertical Scaling :
	Horizontal scaling refers to the scaling done by adding more machines into the already existing pool of resources .
	 Vertical scaling refers to the  scaling done by adding more power like CPU or RAM to an existing machine.
	
4. Need and Working of Hadoop:
	We need hadoop because of its
		# excellence in high-volume batch processing.
		# its ability to cost-effectively scale to rapidly growing data demands.
		# its parallel processing.

	Working of Hadoop:

		Hadoop is an ecosystem of libraries, and each library 
		has its own dedicated tasks to perform. HDFS writes data
		 once to the server and then reads and reuses it many times.
		 When comparing it with continuous multiple read and 
		write actions of other file systems, HDFS exhibits speed with
		 which Hadoop works and hence is considered as a perfect 
		solution to deal with voluminous variety of data.
